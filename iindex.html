						<p>“There’s an entrepreneur right now, scared to death, making excuses, saying, ‘It’s not the right time just yet.’ There’s no such thing as a good time.
							I started an apparel-manufacturing business in the tech-boom years. I mean, come on. Get out of your garage and go take a chance, and start your business.”</p>
						<p>“Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work.
							And the only way to do great work is to love what you do.”</p>
						<p>
							“Embrace what you don’t know, especially in the beginning, because what you don’t know can become your greatest asset.
							It ensures that you will absolutely be doing things different from everybody else.”

						<p>“It’s not about having a specific set time; both personal and professional lives are 24/7.
							It’s simply, more about making the right allocation to each one and recognizing that it’s going to be different every single day.”</p>
						<p>“The question I ask myself like almost every day is, ‘Am I doing the most important thing I could be doing?’…
							Unless I feel like I’m working on the most important problem that I can help with, then I’m not going to feel good about how I’m spending my time.
							And that’s what this company is.”</p>
						<p>
							“I always did something that I was a little not ready to do. I think that, that is how you grow.
							When there’s a moment of ‘Wow, I’m not so sure that I can do this, and you push through those moments, it’s then that you have a breakthrough.
							Sometimes that’s a sign that something really great is about to happen.
							You’re about to grow and learn a lot more about yourself.”
